  title: Semantic API
  description: "The Semantic API complements the Articles API. With the Semantic API,\
    \ you get access to the long list of people, places, organizations and other locations,\
    \ entities and descriptors that make up the controlled vocabulary used as metadata\
    \ by The New York Times (sometimes referred to as Times Tags and used for Times\
    \ Topics pages.\n\n**Note:** In URI examples and field names, *italics* indicate\
    \ placeholders for\nvariables or values. Parentheses ( ) indicate optional items.\
    \ Square brackets [ ] are not a convention â€” when URIs include brackets, interpret\
    \ them literally.\n\n**The Semantic API at a Glance**\n\n**Base URI**\n\n`http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept`\n\
    \n**Scope**\n\nThe New York Times controlled vocabulary (over 100,000 people,\
    \ places,\norganizations and descriptors used to classify New York Times articles\
    \ metadata) and New York Times articles from 1981 to today (excludes wire services\
    \ such as the Associated Press)\n\n**HTTP method**\n\nGET\n\n**Response formats**\n\
    \nJSON\n \n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n### KEY CONCEPTS\n\n\nThe first\
    \ and simplest way to access the API is to refer to a concept is by type. There\
    \ are seven concept types: people, places, organizations, descriptors, creative\
    \ work titles, topics, and public companies. The concept\\_type is a mandatory\
    \ parameter for accessing the Semantic API with a concept type request.\n\nExamples\
    \ of specific concepts, and their associated concept\\_type:  \n\n\n| **Concept\
    \ Type** | **concept\\_type** | **specific\\_concept\\_name**      |\n|------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n\
    | Descriptor       | nytd\\_des         | Absenteeism                      |\n\
    | Location         | nytd\\_geo         | Acapulco (Mexico)                |\n\
    | Organization     | nytd\\_org         | 3M Company                       |\n\
    | Person           | nytd\\_per         | Abbas, Mahmoud                   |\n\
    | Public Company   | nytd\\_porg        | |\n| Title            | nytd\\_ttl \
    \        | The Joy of Painting (TV Program) |\n| Topic            | nytd\\_topic\
    \       | |\n\n\nIf you wish to determine which articles are associated with a\
    \ particular\nconcept, you can use the article search API and specify the concept\
    \ in the fq parameter.\n\n| **Concept Type** | **specific\\_concept\\_name** \
    \     | **Search API Query**                                |\n|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n\
    | Descriptor       | Absenteeism                      | subject:absenteeism  \
    \                               |\n| Location         | Acapulco (Mexico)    \
    \            | glocations: \"Acapulco (Mexico)\"                     |\n| Organization\
    \     | 3M Company                       | organizations: \"3M Company\"     \
    \                    |\n| Person           | Abbas, Mahmoud                  \
    \ | persons: \"Abbas, Mahmoud\"                           |\n| Title         \
    \   | The Joy of Painting (TV Program) | creative\\_works: \"The Joy of Painting\
    \ (TV Program)\" |\n\nIf you are not sure the name and type of the concept that\
    \ you are looking for, you can use the search endpoint of the semantic API to\
    \ find concepts by substring.\n\nIn addition to the mandatory parameters corresponding\
    \ to the three ways of accessing the Semantic API, optional parameters can also\
    \ be applied. The \"fields\" parameter can be given the value \"all\" to provide\
    \ a global request that\nincludes all optional parameters.\n\nRequests\n--------\n\
    \nThis section summarizes Semantic Search request URIs and parameters. For best\
    \ results, first review Key Concepts, then come back here to start building your\
    \ request URI.\n\n### URI STRUCTURE\n\nSemantic concept requests use the following\
    \ URI structure:\n\n-   **Name**: For concept type and specific concept requests:\n\
    \n```\nhttp://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/<concept_type>/<specific_concept>.json(?optional_parameters)&api-key=your-API-key\n\
    ```\n\n\n-   **Search**: For searching the complete list of concepts:\n\n```\n\
    http://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/search.json(?optional_parameters)&api-key=your-API-key\n\
    ```\n\n \n\n###  \n\nConstructing a Semantic API Request by Concept Type and Specific\
    \ Concept\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
    \nconcept\\_type is one of seven types:\n\n1.  *nytd\\_geo* for a location\n\n\
    2.  *nytd\\_per* for a person\n\n3.  *nytd\\_org* for an organization\n\n4.  *nytd\\\
    _des* for a descriptor\n\n5.  *nytd\\_ttl* for a creative work title\n\n6.  *nytd\\\
    _topic* for a topic\n\n7.  *nytd\\_porg* for a public company\n\nspecific\\_concept\\\
    _name is a term in The New York Times controlled vocabulary.\n\nThe general form\
    \ for a Semantic API request by concept type and specific concept:\n\n```\nhttp://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/<concept_type>/<specific_concept_name>.json(?optional_parameters)&api-key=your-API-key\n\
    ```\n\nExamples of Semantic API requests by concept type and specific concept:\n\
    \n```\nhttp://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/nytd_des/Baseball.json?fields=all&api-key=your-API-key\n\
    \nhttp://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/nytd_per/Obama, Barack.json?fields=pages,links,scope_notes&api-key=your-API-key\
    \ (you need the space after the comma separating last name and first name)\n```\n\
    \ \n \nConstructing a Semantic API Search Query\n---------------------------\n\
    \nThe general form for Search Query consists of a query string\n(*query=*query\\\
    _term) and optional parameters.\n\n```\nhttp://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/search.json?query=<query_term>(&optional_parameters)&api-key=your-api-key\n\
    ```\n\nThe optional parameters for a Search Query are *concept\\_type*,\n*concept\\\
    _uri*, *article\\_uri*. These optional parameters are derived from\nthe other\
    \ types of Semantic API requests and are explained in the instructions for constructing\
    \ those requests (above).\n\nAn example of a Search Query, it asks for all of\
    \ the concepts of type\n'nytd\\_per' that contain the substring \"Evan\" and return\
    \ the result formatted in\nJSON.\n\n```\nhttp://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/search.json?query=evan&concept_type=nytd_per&api-key=your-api-key\n\
    ```\n\n \n-\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThese examples do not include the required\
    \ `api-key` parameter. Be sure to\ninclude your API key in your request.\n\n###\
    \ REQUESTS & RESPONSES\n\n**Request**\n\n-   **Name**: Requests all fields for\
    \ the concept with concept\\_type\n    ='nytd\\_geo' and concept\\_name='Kansas'.\
    \  \n\n```\nhttp://api.nytimes.com/svc/semantic/v2/concept/name/nytd_geo/Kansas?fields=all&api-key=your-API-key\n\
