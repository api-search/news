  Spotify’s platform revolutionized music listening forever when we launched in
  2008. Our move into podcasting brought innovation and a new generation of
  listeners to the medium, and in 2022 we entered the next audio market primed
  for growth with the addition of audiobooks. Today, more listeners than ever
  can discover, manage, and enjoy over 100 million tracks, 5 million podcasts
  titles, and 350,000 audiobooks a la carte on Spotify. We are the world’s most
  popular audio streaming subscription service with more than 574 million users,
  including 226 million subscribers in more than 180 markets.
